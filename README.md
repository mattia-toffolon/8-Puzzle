# 8-Puzzle
This program written in Java solves the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

*The Problem:* \
The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are sorted by label in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square. \
\
*My Solution:* \
Trought the use of the A* search algorithm applied to problem by introducing the Manhattan Distance of each tile of the puzzle i managed to find a solution. The program has also been optimized by avoiding to calculate unnecessary paths and thanks to some minor adjustments. \
\
*How to use it* \
After you compiled the *Solver.java* file you will just have to run it specifying whitch puzzle (in the .txt format) has to be solved.\
Example: *java Solver puzzle.tx* \
