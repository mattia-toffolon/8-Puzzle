# 8-Puzzle
This program written in Java solves the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

#### The Problem: 
The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are sorted by label in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square. 

#### My Solution: 
Trought the use of the A* search algorithm applied to problem by introducing the Manhattan Distance of each tile of the puzzle i managed to find a solution. The program has also been optimized by avoiding to calculate unnecessary paths and thanks to some minor adjustments. 

#### How to use it: 
After you compiled *Solver.java* you'll just have to run it specifying whitch puzzle (in the .txt format) has to be solved. What you'll see printed in your terminal is firstly the minimun number of moves that are necessary to solve the puzzle and after that all the moves in sequence, each represented by the corrisponding array version of the puzzle.\
*Example:* `java Solver puzzle.txt `
